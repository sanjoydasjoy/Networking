### What is Static Routing?

A static route is like giving your router a set of instructions written by hand. You're telling it, "If you want to send data to a certain network, go this way." The router won’t try to figure it out itself—you have to give it the directions.

<br><br>

### Why Use Static Routing?

You use static routing when:

- Your network is small or simple.
- You want full control over how data moves.
- You want to create a backup route in case the main one fails.

<br><br>

### Types of Static Routes

1. Standard static route  
   A regular route that tells the router how to reach one specific network.

2. Default static route  
   A general route that says, "If you don’t know where to send the data, use this path."

3. Floating static route  
   A backup route. The router will use this only if the main route is not working.

4. Summary static route  
   One route that can cover several smaller networks. It keeps the routing table cleaner.

<br><br>

### How to Tell the Router Where to Send Data

There are three ways:

1. Next-hop IP address  
   You only give the IP address of the next router.  
   Example:  
   `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.2.2`  
   This means: to reach the 192.168.2.0 network, send data to the router at 172.16.2.2.

2. Exit interface  
   You only give the name of the router's outgoing interface.  
   Example:  
   `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 Serial0/1/0`  
   This means: to reach that network, just send the data out through Serial0/1/0.

3. Both next-hop and interface  
   You give both the IP address of the next router and the name of the outgoing interface.  
   Example:  
   `ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 Serial0/1/0 172.16.2.2`

### The Example Situation

You have 3 routers: R1, R2, and R3.  
R1 is directly connected to R2 — but **not** to R3.

#### IPv4 Example from your message:

When you type this on R1:

```
R1# ping 172.16.2.2
```

It works. That IP belongs to R2 — and they are directly connected.

But when you try this:

```
R1# ping 192.168.2.1
```

It fails. That IP belongs to a device on R3’s network.

Why did it fail?

Because R1 doesn’t know how to get to the 192.168.2.0 network.  
There’s **no static route** or dynamic route telling it what to do.

Same thing happens in the **IPv6 part** of the example.

R1 can ping R2 using:

```
R1# ping 2001:db8:acad:2::2
```

But when it tries:

```
R1# ping 2001:db8:cafe:2::1
```

It fails — because there is **no route** to the R3 side.

---

### Summary

That’s the example I was referring to:

- You try to ping a device on a network that isn’t directly connected.
- It fails because the router doesn’t know the way.
- You solve it by **adding a static route**.

### In Short

| Term                  | What it means                           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Static Route          | Manually added route                    |
| Default Route         | General path when no other path is found |
| Next-hop              | The IP address of the next router       |
| Exit Interface        | The port or path to send data out       |
| Floating Static Route | A backup route                          |
| Summary Route         | One route that includes many networks   |
