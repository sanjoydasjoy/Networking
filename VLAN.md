# What is a **VLAN**?

- **VLAN** stands for **Virtual Local Area Network**.
- It's like **creating mini-networks** inside a physical switch.
- You group similar devices **logically**, not physically.

> Think of VLANs like rooms in a building: people in one room can talk easily with each other, but they need permission (a door or hallway) to talk to people in another room.

<br>

## **Why Use VLANs?**

| **Benefit**               | **Explanation** |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Smaller Broadcast Domains** | Devices in one VLAN don’t hear broadcasts from another. Less unnecessary traffic. |
| **Improved Security** | Only devices in the same VLAN can talk directly—helps separate users (e.g., students vs staff). |
| **Better Organization** | Easier to manage groups like IT, HR, Sales separately. |
| **Reduced Cost** | No need for multiple switches—**one switch** can support multiple VLANs. |
| **Improved Performance** | Less traffic on each VLAN = **faster network**. |
| **Simpler Management** | Same type of users/devices grouped together → easy to apply policies and manage apps. |

<br>

## Key Concept:

> **All devices in the same VLAN can communicate freely. To talk between VLANs, a router or Layer 3 switch is needed.**

# Types of VLANs



### 1. **Default VLAN**  
- **VLAN 1** is the default for everything (data, management, native).
- Comes pre-configured on all Cisco switches.
- **You can't delete or rename it.**


```
*Best practice:* Don’t use VLAN 1 for actual traffic—create your own.
By default, all switch ports are part of VLAN 1, and it’s used for everything (data, management, etc.).

But using VLAN 1 for everything is not safe or efficient because:

Security risk:
If everything runs through VLAN 1, attackers know where to look.

Too much traffic:
VLAN 1 can get flooded with unnecessary broadcasts.

No separation:
You can’t organize devices into groups (like students vs. teachers).


So, what should we do?
Instead of using VLAN 1, we should:
 - Create a new VLAN (e.g., VLAN 10 for users, VLAN 99 for management).
 - Assign ports/devices to these VLANs.
 - Leave VLAN 1 unused or reserve it for special tasks (like switch-to-switch communication).

```

### **Data VLAN**  
Think of this as the **main road** for normal traffic like web browsing, emails, file sharing — the kind of stuff you do on your laptop or phone.

**What’s a VLAN again?**  
A **Virtual LAN** groups devices **logically**, not physically. So even if devices are plugged into the same switch, they can be isolated in separate VLANs.

Now back to **Data VLANs**:

By default, **all ports on a switch are in VLAN 1**, and VLAN 1 is also used internally by the switch.

**Why avoid VLAN 1 for user data?**  
Because VLAN 1 is used for **management and control traffic**, mixing user data here can cause **security and troubleshooting issues**.  
So we **create custom VLANs** like:
- VLAN 10 → for students  
- VLAN 20 → for staff

<br>

### **Native VLAN**

Okay, this one’s specific to **trunk links**.

**Trunk link?**  
A **trunk** is a cable that connects **switch-to-switch** (not switch to PC). It can carry traffic for **multiple VLANs** at once.

Here’s the twist:

Normally, VLAN traffic is **tagged** with its VLAN ID, so switches know where it belongs.

But traffic for the **native VLAN is NOT tagged**.

Why does this matter?  
If **both switches don’t agree** on what the native VLAN is, you’ll get **miscommunication**, like frames going into the wrong VLAN.  
So we always **manually set** the native VLAN to the **same ID** (e.g., VLAN 99) on both sides of the trunk.

<br>

### **Management VLAN**

This is the VLAN that your **IT person uses to access the switch remotely**.

**What do you mean by access the switch?**  
You can log into a switch using **SSH or Telnet** (like a terminal for the switch). That traffic needs an **IP address**, and that IP is assigned to a **VLAN interface**, usually a separate one called the **management VLAN**.

Why separate it?  
You don’t want **random users** accessing the switch.  
So we **isolate this VLAN** and connect only **IT/admin systems** to it.

Example:  
VLAN 99 is used just for managing the switch — you assign it an IP like `192.168.99.1`.

<br>

### **Voice VLAN**

Used for **VoIP phones** — these are phones that use the internet instead of traditional telephone lines.

Why does voice traffic need a separate VLAN?  
Because voice is **super sensitive to delays and jitter**. If a voice packet arrives late or out of order, the call sounds glitchy.

Benefits of a separate Voice VLAN:  
- You can apply **QoS (Quality of Service)** rules to **prioritize voice packets**.  
- Keeps voice traffic away from **regular data traffic**, so it doesn’t get slowed down.

Example:  
- A port on the switch connects to a **VoIP phone**.  
- The phone has a **PC plugged into it**.  
- That port handles **two VLANs**:
  - Voice VLAN → for the phone  
  - Data VLAN → for the PC
